# Hello Dolly Redux

"This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong."

Written by Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress, Hello Dolly is included with all WordPress installations as a demonstration of how to write a simple plugin. However, 15 years later, it's no longer demonstrating the best practices that are now in use.

Hello Dolly Redux is a fork of Hello Dolly, with improvements across the board to both code and documentation quality. What's NOT happening is any change to the resulting output - Hello Dolly Redux will display lyrics in the dashboard in exactly the same way as the original plugin. 

If you have any further suggestions for quality improvements, please [let me know](https://github.com/dartiss/hello-dolly-redux/issues). Or just add your own Pull Request.
